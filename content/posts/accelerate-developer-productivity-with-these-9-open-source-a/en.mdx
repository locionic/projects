# Accelerate developer productivity with these 9 open source AI and MCP projects

GitHub Copilot and VS Code, together with the Microsoft Open Source Program Office (OSPO), have sponsored nine open‑source **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** projects.  These projects unlock AI‑native workflows, agentic tooling, and new ways for developers to interact with codebases, browsers, and real‑world applications.

With MCP, developers can push artificial intelligence and autonomous agents to understand, manipulate and even execute code across a wide range of ecosystems.  From browser extensions to game‑engine integrations, the new tools bring AI‑first productivity to the everyday developer experience.

## Major Themes

The nine projects cluster around **three recurring principles**:
1. **Framework & platform integrations** – plug MCP into popular ecosystems.
2. **Developer experience & AI‑enhanced coding** – let LLMs act as intelligent IDE assistants.
3. **Automation, testing & orchestration** – elevate MCP to production‑grade reliability.

## 1. Framework and platform integrations

These packages expose MCP capabilities inside widely used frameworks, making it simple for agents to work with real‑world tools and workflows.

| Project | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `fastapi_mcp` | Exposes secure FastAPI endpoints as MCP tools with minimal setup, authentication, and limited configuration—all via a single infrastructure. |
| `nuxt-mcp` | Adds Nuxt developer tools for route inspection and SSR debugging, allowing models to understand your Vite/Nuxt app better. |
| `unity-mcp` | Interfaces with Unity’s game‑engine APIs, giving AI tools the ability to manage assets, control scenes, edit scripts, and automate routine tasks in Unity. |

---

## 2. Developer experience and AI‑enhanced coding

These tools turn LLMs and agents into true colleagues, improving workflow, code comprehension, and safe execution.

| Project | How it helps developers |
|--------|------------------------|
| `context7` | Pulls up‑to‑date, version‑specific documentation and code snippets directly from your repo, injecting them into AI prompts for richer context. |
| `serena` | A semantic code editing and retrieval toolkit that lets agents search, edit, and manipulate code with understanding of intent. |
| `Peekaboo` | Swift code analysis that transforms what’s on the screen into actionable AI context, enabling full GUI automation and AI‑powered assistants. |
| `coderunner` | Turns LLMs into an instant, local execution partner. It writes and runs code in a sandboxed environment on your machine, auto‑installs tools, reads files directly, and returns outputs and artifacts. |

---

## 3. Automation, testing and orchestration

These projects ensure MCP can scale reliably in production, providing robust testing, debugging, and workflow tools.

| Project | Purpose |
|--------|--------|
| `n8n-mcp` | An ultra‑optimized platform that boosts n8n’s workflow automation. It streamlines node orchestration and integrates AI models to help users better understand and work with n8n nodes. |
| `inspector` | A debugging toolkit for MCP servers. Inspect protocol handshakes, tool registrations, resource definitions, prompts, and OAuth flows, with a built‑in LLM playground simulations to catch regressions. |

## Build with MCP today

Developers are already using these projects to accelerate coding, testing, and deployment.  GitHub Copilot and VS Code teams are eager to sponsor more open‑source initiatives that push MCP forward into agent‑native development.

> **Join the movement** – sponsor open‑source projects through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/) and help grow the MCP ecosystem.  
> Start experimenting with MCP in VS Code and GitHub Copilot now!
