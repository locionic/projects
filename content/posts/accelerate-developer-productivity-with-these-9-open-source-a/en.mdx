## Introduction

GitHub Copilot, the VSâ€¯Code teams, and the Microsoft Open Source Program Office (OSPO) have jointly sponsored nine openâ€‘source Microsoftâ€¯Copilotâ€¯Protocol (MCP) projects. These initiatives unlock AIâ€‘native workflows, agentic tooling, and new ways of working by embedding MCP into realâ€‘world environments and developer experiences.

With MCPâ€™s emergence, developers are discovering revolutionary ways for AI and agents to interact with tools, codebases, and browsers. Built on top of the core protocol, browser extensions, and editorâ€‘integrated tools are emerging, enabling AIâ€‘native workflows and ushering in a new generation of agentic tooling.

Below we outline the nine projects, grouped by the three major themes that emerge from their work.

---

## 1. Framework & Platform Integrations  
### Bringing MCP to Popular Ecosystems

These projects expose MCP capabilities inside widely used frameworks, making it easier for agents to interact with realâ€‘world applications and workflows.

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **fastapi_mcp** | Exposes secure FastAPI endpoints as MCP tools with minimal setup, authentication, and limited configurationâ€”all on a unified infrastructure. |
| **nuxt-mcp**    | Provides Nuxt developer tools for route inspection and SSR debugging, helping models better understand your Vite/Nuxt app. |
| **unity-mcp**   | Allows interfacing with Unity gameâ€‘engine APIs AIâ€‘assisted game development; gives AI tools to manage assets, control scenes, edit scripts, and automate tasks inside Unity. |

---

## 2. Developer Experience & AIâ€‘Enhanced Coding  
### AIâ€‘First Productivity in the IDE

These projects turn AI, LLMs, and agents into intelligent IDE assistants, improving workflows, semantic code understanding, and safe execution.

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **context7** | Pulls upâ€‘toâ€‘date, versionâ€‘specific documentation and code examples directly from your repository, embedding them into LLM prompts for richer context. |
| **serena**   | A semantic code editing and retrieval toolkit that empowers agents to search, edit, and clone code based on meaning rather than text. |
| **Peekaboo** | Swift code analysis that turns the UI on your screen into actionable AI context, enabling full GUI automation and AI assistants. |
| **coderunner** | Turns LLMs into a local execution partner: writes and runs code in a preâ€‘configured sandbox, autoâ€‘installs tools, reads files, and returns outputs and generated artifacts. |

---

## 3. Automation, Testing & Orchestration  
### Ensuring Reliability and Scale for MCP Infrastructures

These projects extend MCP into productionâ€‘grade tooling for automation pipelines, testing, and debugging, helping teams run MCP at scale.

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **n8n-mcp** | An ultraâ€‘optimized extension that enhancesâ€¯n8nâ€™s workflow automation, streamlining the creation and orchestration of workflows and integrating AI models for better node understanding. |
| **inspector** | A comprehensive tool for testing and debugging MCP servers: inspect protocol handshakes, tools, resources, prompts, and OAuth flows; run LLM playgrounds and evaluation simulations to catch regressions. |

---

## Conclusion

Developers are building faster than ever, thanks to AI and MCP. The nine projects above represent some of the most impactful tools emerging in the MCP ecosystemâ€”each one deeply rooted in real developer needs. The GitHub Copilot and VSâ€¯Code teams are eager to support further openâ€‘source innovations that push MCP toward agentâ€‘native development.

Want to help? You can sign up for **GitHub Sponsors** today and support these projects (and many more) or explore MCP right now using VSâ€¯Code and GitHub Copilot.
