## Introducing Agent HQ: Any agent, any way you work

At GitHub Universe 2025 we revealed the next evolution for developers—an all‑in‑one workflow that lets anyone orchestrate *any* agent, *anywhere*, whether on the web, in VS Code, or from the command line.

## Mission Control: Your command center everywhere

* Unified dashboard across GitHub, VS Code, mobile, and the CLI.
* Assign, steer, and track multiple agents in parallel from any device.
* Branch controls for run‑time policy on agent‑generated code.
* Identity & policy features let you treat agents like any other developer.

**Key capabilities**

| Feature | What it gives you |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Agent selection** | Pick from a fleet of pre‑built agents. |
| **Parallel dispatch** | Run many agents simultaneously. |
| **Progress tracking** | Monitor status at a glance. |
| **Policy enforcement** | Set checks, policies, and access per agent. |

## Confidence & control for teams

### Code quality  
- **GitHub Code Quality** (public preview): org‑wide visibility and governance for maintainability, reliability, and test coverage.
- Copilot’s security checks now include maintainability and reliability impact.

### Code review  
- Copilot adds an initial first‑line review in its own workflow, catching issues before developers see the code.

### Metrics  
- **Copilot metrics dashboard** (public preview): see impact and usage across the organization.

### Enterprise controls  
- **AI control plane**: governance layer for AI access, agent policy, audit logging, and metric collection.
- Dictate which agents/models are available and track usage organization‑wide.
