# Top Security Researcher Shares Their Bug Bounty Process

## Introduction

As Cybersecurity Awareness Month comes to a close, the GitHub Bug Bounty team is thrilled to spotlight another topâ€‘performing researcher in our program: **@devâ€‘bio**. GitHub is committed to keeping the code that powers millions of projects safe, and our Bug Bounty Program is a key part of that missionâ€”especially as we launch AIâ€‘powered features like Copilot, the Copilot coding agent, and GitHub Spark.

## The VIP Bounty Program

We audit the researchers in our public program to identify those who consistently demonstrate expertise and impact. These highâ€‘performers receive an invitation to our exclusive VIP Bounty Program, which offers:

- Early previews of beta products and features before public launch  
- Dedicated engagement with GitHub Bug Bounty staff and the engineers behind the features theyâ€™re testing ðŸ˜„  
- Unique Hacktocat swag, including this yearâ€™s brandâ€‘new collection  

Learn more about the VIP program and how you can earn an invitation in our full blog post.

## Spotlight: @devâ€‘bio

### Background

@devâ€‘bio joined the Bug Bounty program by chance while working on a personal project. With a strong background in software engineering, they are naturally curious about how systems behaveâ€”especially when handling complex edge cases. That curiosity often leads them into deep rabbit holes and, eventually, impactful findings.

### What Keeps Them Going

The thrill of revealing how seemingly minor issues can evolve into serious vulnerabilities is a major motivator. Demonstrating the realâ€‘world impact of a small oversight feels incredibly rewarding.

### Life Outside the Lab

A new father of two, @devâ€‘bio cherishes time with family and values the support of their partner, who provides uninterrupted hours for side projects. Living in Norway offers easy access to nature, and hiking, camping, and crossâ€‘country skiing are favorite ways to recharge and gain perspective.

## Keeping Up With Vulnerability Trends

- Reads writeâ€‘ups from other researchers to see new approaches and emerging vulnerabilities.  
- Stays ahead by exploring underâ€‘researched areas.  
- Works as a security engineer focused on software supplyâ€‘chain security, researching gaps and developing mitigation solutions.

## Tools and Workflows

- Prefers writing custom tools over relying solely on offâ€‘theâ€‘shelf solutions; this deepens understanding and uncovers new research avenues.  
- Plans to release a toolkit for building offline graphs of GitHub organizations, with an extensible query suite to uncover misconfigurations and hidden attack paths.

## Favorite Bug Classes

- Injectionâ€‘related vulnerabilities  
- Subtle logical flaws and overlooked assumptions  
- Novel techniques for bypassing strict contentâ€‘security policies  

Demonstrating how benign findings can chain together into significant impact is a particular passion, as these vulnerabilities often expose deeper design weaknesses.

## Research Process

The most significant discoveries have been accidental, driven by curiosity rather than a rigid methodology. When something unusual is noticed, the process involves:

1. Digging deeper and peeling back layers to understand the root cause.  
2. Documenting each step to map potential attack paths.  
3. Building a clear, comprehensive picture that supports further analysis and reporting.

## Advice for Aspiring Bug Bounty Researchers

- Donâ€™t settle for a simple finding; dig deeper and explore its implications.  
- Understanding the bigger picture can turn seemingly benign issues into highâ€‘impact vulnerabilities.
