When you start working with databases, **MySQL** is often one of the first sytems you'll encounter.
It's open-source, powerful, and widely used across both small projects and large-scale applications.

In this post, we'll walk through some of the most common MySQL commands - from connecting to your server, creating tables, and inserting data, to running queries and managing your database effectively.

---

## Connecting to a MySQL Server

To access a MySQL database, you'll need to connect using your username and password.
Here are a few common connection commands:

```bash
mysql -u [username] -p
mysql -u [username] -p [database]
mysqldump -u [username] -p [database] > data_backup.sql
```

Use `quit` or `exit` to close your session when you're done.
The `help` command shows all available MySQL commands inside the terminal.

## Creating and Displaying Databases

Once connected, you can create and epxlore databases:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE zoo;
SHOW DATABASES;
USE zoo;
```

The `CREATE DATABASE` command makes a new database.
`SHOW DATABASES` lists all databases, and `USE` switches you into one so you can start creating tables inside it.

If you want to remove a database, simply use:
```sql
DROP DATABASE zoo;
```

## Creating Tables
Tables are where your data lives.
Let's say you're building a small zoo management system.
You might want one table for animal habitats and another for the animals themselves:
```sql
CREATE TABLE HABITAT (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(64)
);

CREATE TABLE animal (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(64),
  species VARCHAR(64),
  age INT,
  habitat_id INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (habitat_id) REFERENCES habitat(id)
);
```

Here, we also defined a foreign key to link animals to their habitats - a common relational database practice.

## Modifying Tables
Sometimes your data model evolves.
MySQL provides flexible ways to change your table structure:

```sql
ALTER TABLE animal ADD COLUMN nickname varchar(64);
ALTER TABLE animal RENAME COLUMN id TO identifier;
ALTER TABLE animal MODIFY COLUMN name VARCHAR(128);
ALTER TABLE animal DROP COLUMN nickname;
```

And when a table is no logner needed:
```sql
DROP TABLE animal;
```

---
## Querying Data
Now for the fun part - querying data.
You can use `SELECT` statements to retrieve and organize information:
```sql
SELECT species, AVG(age) as average_age
FROM animal
WHERE id != 3
GROUP BY species
HAVING AVG(age) > 3
ORDER BY AVG(age) DESC;
```

This query finds the average age of each species (except those with ID 3) and lists only the ones with an average age greater than 3.

To combine data from multiple tables, you can use JOINs:
```sql
SELECT city.name, country.name
FROM city
INNER JOIN country
  ON city.country_id = country.id;
```

---
## Aggregation and Grouping
Aggregation functions like `COUNT`, `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX` help summarize data:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) from animal;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT name) FROM animal;
```
To group results by a category:
```sql
SELECT species, COUNT(id)
FROM animal
GROUP BY species;
```

---
## Inserting, Updateing, and Deleting Data
You can add data with `INSERT`, change it with `UPDATE`, and remove it with `DELETE`.
```sql
INSERT INTO habitat VALUES (1, 'River'), (2, 'Forest');
INSERT INTO habitat (name) VALUES ('Savanna');

UPDATE animal
SET species = 'Duck', name = 'Quack'
WHERE id = 2;

DELETE FROM animal WHERE id = 1;
TRUNCATE TABLE animal;
```

## Conclusion
Mastering MySQL begins with understanding these fundamental commands.
Whether you're managing a small project or working in a production environment, these queries form the backbone of database operations.
* Practice these commands in local environment - repetition is the best way to truly understand SQL.
