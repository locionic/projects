# GitHub SSH Key vs Personal Access Token

## SSH Key

**Purpose:**
Securely authenticate you to GitHub without typing passwords or tokens.

**How it works:**
- Generate a public/private key pair on your machine.
- Keep the **private key** safe on your computer.
- Upload the **public key** to GitHub.
- When you connect via SSH (`git@github.com:username/repo.git`), GitHub verifies the key pair.

**Where used:**
- SSH protocol: `git@github.com:...`
- Often used for day-to-day Git cloning, pushing, and pulling.

**Advantages:**
- No need to store passwords or tokens.
- Can be locked with a passphrase.
- Can be restricted to a specific machine.

## Personal Access Token (PAT)

**Purpose:**
Authenticate for HTTPS Git operations **and** GitHub API calls.

**How it works:**
- Generate the token from GitHub's settings.
- Use it instead of your GitHub password when pushing/pulling over HTTPS or in API calls.

**Where used:**
- HTTPS protocol: `https://github.com/username/repo.git`
- GitHub REST/GraphQL APIs.

**Advantages:**
- Easy to set up-no key generation required.
- Works in scripts, CI/CD pipelines, and APIs.

**Downsides:**
- If leaked, anyone can use it until revoked.
- Less secure if stored in plain text without encryption.

## Quick Comparision

| Feature | SSH Key | Personal |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Protocol | SSH | HTTPS |
| Setup | Generate key pair locally, add public key to GitHub | Generate token on GitHub |
| Main Use | Git clone/push/pull without password | Git over HTTPS & API calls |
| Security | Private key stays on your machine | Token must be stored securely |
| Expiration | No (unless removed) | Can expired automatically |
| API Use | Not directly | Yes, designed for it |

## Recommendations

- **SSH Key:** Best for long-term work from your personal machine.
- **PAT:** Best for automation, scripts, CI/CD and API interactions.
