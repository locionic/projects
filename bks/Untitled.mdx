## What can MDX do?

It allows us to write JSX in markdown

This is a bar chart of precipitation in 20184444.

<Chart data={[6, 5, 2, 4.5, 1.5, 2.5, 2, 2.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 7]} color="#3b82f6"/>

First of all, this is not a picture, but a rendering using code.

I have seen many companiesâ€™ WeChat tweets, and many places use pictures for layout. Many designers spend a lot of time on proofreading copywriting and design drafts. I am taking advantage of the advantages of MDX and developing MDX Editor to complement the shortcomings of WeChat layout. You only need to write the article in markdown format and you can copy it to the WeChat public account backend with one click.

## accomplish

The Chart component is defined in config

```jsx
function Chart({ data = [], color }) {
  return (
    <div className="snowfall">
      {data.map((d, i) => (
        <div
          key={i}
          className="snowfall-bar"
          style={{
            height: d * 20,
            backgroundColor: color,
          }}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

css

```css
.snowfall {
  display: flex;
  align-items: flex-end;
  justify-content: center;
}

.snowfall-bar {
  flex-basis: 0;
  flex-grow: 1;
  margin: 4px;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: end;
  font-size: 10px;
  color: #eff6ff;
}
```
