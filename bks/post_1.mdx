## How does Java differ from Javascript?

**Java** and **JavaScript** are distinct programming languages with differences in their syntax and primary uses.

* **Java** was created by Sun Microsystems in the 1990s (now owned by Oracle). It's a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language widely used for building various software applications, including:
  * Desktop applications
  * Web applications
  * Mobile applications (especially for Android)

  Java is also a **statiscally typed language**, meaning a variable's data type must be explicitly declared and known at compile time. You need to understand the tpye of data you're working with before the program starts running.

* In contrast, **JavaScript** was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995. It's primarily a scripting language. JavaScript is a **dynamically typed language**, meaning a variable's data type is determined at runtime. You don't have to declare the data type of a variable before using it.

## What are the various data types that exist in JavaScript?

JavaScript has two main categories of data types: **primative** and **non-primitive** (also known as reference) data types.

### Primitive Data Types

Primitive data types are the fundamental building blocks of data in JavaScript. They are **immutable**, meaning their values cannot be changed once created. They are stored in memory as single values. Examples include:

* **Object**: A collection of key-value pairs( e.g., `{ name: 'cess', age: 26 };`).
* **Array**: An ordered list of values (e.g.m `[10, 12, 13]`).
* **Function**: A block of code designed to perform a particular task (e.g., `function add(a = 10, b = 5) { return a + b; }`).

## What is the difference between `undefined` and `null` in JavaScript?

* An **`undefined`** variable is one that has been declared by the developer but has not yet been assigned a value.

  ```javascript
  // Example 1
  let study;
  console.log(study); // undefined

  // Example 2
  let myObj = {}; // empty object
  console.log(myObj.name); // undefined because 'name' property doesn't exists
  ```

## What is the use of the `isNaN` function?

The `isNaN` function is used to check if a value is **"Not a Number."** It attempts to convert the given value to a number and then checks if the result is `NaN` (Not a Number).

* If the value is **not a number**, it will return `true`
* If the value is **is a number**, it will return `false`

```javascript
console.log(isNaN("study")); // true
console.log(isNaN(4)); // false
```
