## How does Java differ from Javascript?

**Java** and **JavaScript** are distinct programming languages with differences in their syntax and primary uses.

* **Java** was created by Sun Microsystems in the 1990s (now owned by Oracle). It's a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language widely used for building various software applications, including:
  * Desktop applications
  * Web applications
  * Mobile applications (especially for Android)

  Java is also a **statiscally typed language**, meaning a variable's data type must be explicitly declared and known at compile time. You need to understand the tpye of data you're working with before the program starts running.
