## What is full-stack development?
**Full-stack development** refers to the practice of building and maintaining both the frontend and backend of a web application or web service. A full-stack developer works across all layers of the application, ensuring seamless functionality from the user interface to the server and database.

Key aspects of a full-stack development include:
- **Frontend Development**: involves creating the parts of the application that users interact with directly, such as buttons, forms, and layouts. Tools and technologies often used include **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and frameworks like React, ANgular, or Vue.js. This may also include building Progressive Web APps (PWAs) for enhanced user experiences.
- **Backend Development**: Focuses on server-side logic, databases and APIs that power the frontend. COmmon programming languages for backend development include **Python, Java, Node.js, PHP**.
- **Databases and Storage**: Managing data through relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) or non-relational databases (e.g., MongoDB, Redis).
- **DevOps and Deployment**: Setting up hosting environments, CI/CD pipelines, and handling cloud services to deploy and maintain applications.

Full-stack developers are valued for their versatility and and ability to understand how different components of a web application interact, making them crucial for delivering well-rounded, functional products.

## Explain the difference between lcient-side and server-side programming
The **client-side** and **server-side** refer to two distinct parts of a **web application** that work together to deliver functionality to users. Understanding their roles is essential for building efficient and responsive applications.

### Client-side
- **What it ddoes**: this is the part of the application that runs in the user's browser. It handles user interfaces and teractions, allowing users to see and interact with the applictaion.
- ** Key characteristics:
  - Executes **JavaScript code** directly in the browser to handle tasks like form validation, animations and dynamic content updates (through DOM - updates)
  - Manages rendering of HTML and CSS for a seamless visual experience.
  - Often communicates with the server via **REST** (Representational State Transfer) APIs to fetch or send data asynchronously.
- **Examples**:
  - Clicking a button that triggers a JavaScript function to show a popup
  - Fetching additional items on a page using fetch() or axios without a full page reload.
### Server-side
- **What it does**: this part operates on the server and processes requests from the client, performing tasks like database queries, busniness logic and serving responses.
- **Key characteristics**:
  - Executes server-side programming languages like Python, Java or Node.js
  - Handles sensitive operations like authentication and data storage securely.
  - Sends data to the client in structured formats (e.g., JSON) via REST APIs for rendering
- **Examples:
  - Processing a login request by verifying credentials in a database.
  - Returning a list of products in JSON format for the client to display dynamically.
##  What is the purpose of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development?
- HTML: Defines the structure and content of a webpage.
- CSS: Styles the webpage (colors, layout, fonts).
- JavaScript: Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to the webpage.
