## What is full-stack development?
**Full-stack development** refers to the practice of building and maintaining both the frontend and backend of a web application or web service. A full-stack developer works across all layers of the application, ensuring seamless functionality from the user interface to the server and database.

Key aspects of a full-stack development include:
- **Frontend Development**: involves creating the parts of the application that users interact with directly, such as buttons, forms, and layouts. Tools and technologies often used include **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and frameworks like React, ANgular, or Vue.js. This may also include building Progressive Web APps (PWAs) for enhanced user experiences.
- **Backend Development**: Focuses on server-side logic, databases and APIs that power the frontend. COmmon programming languages for backend development include **Python, Java, Node.js, PHP**.
- **Databases and Storage**: Managing data through relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) or non-relational databases (e.g., MongoDB, Redis).
- **DevOps and Deployment**: Setting up hosting environments, CI/CD pipelines, and handling cloud services to deploy and maintain applications.

Full-stack developers are valued for their versatility and and ability to understand how different components of a web application interact, making them crucial for delivering well-rounded, functional products.

## Explain the difference between lcient-side and server-side programming
The **client-side** and **server-side** refer to two distinct parts of a **web application** that work together to deliver functionality to users. Understanding their roles is essential for building efficient and responsive applications.

### Client-side
- **What it ddoes**: this is the part of the application that runs in the user's browser. It handles user interfaces and teractions, allowing users to see and interact with the applictaion.
- ** Key characteristics:
  - Executes **JavaScript code** directly in the browser to handle tasks like form validation, animations and dynamic content updates (through DOM - updates)
  - Manages rendering of HTML and CSS for a seamless visual experience.
  - Often communicates with the server via **REST** (Representational State Transfer) APIs to fetch or send data asynchronously.
- **Examples**:
  - Clicking a button that triggers a JavaScript function to show a popup
  - Fetching additional items on a page using fetch() or axios without a full page reload.
### Server-side
- **What it does**: this part operates on the server and processes requests from the client, performing tasks like database queries, busniness logic and serving responses.
- **Key characteristics**:
  - Executes server-side programming languages like Python, Java or Node.js
  - Handles sensitive operations like authentication and data storage securely.
  - Sends data to the client in structured formats (e.g., JSON) via REST APIs for rendering
- **Examples:
  - Processing a login request by verifying credentials in a database.
  - Returning a list of products in JSON format for the client to display dynamically.
##  What is the purpose of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development?
- HTML: Defines the structure and content of a webpage.
- CSS: Styles the webpage (colors, layout, fonts).
- JavaScript: Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to the webpage.
## What is a REST API, and why is it used?
A REST API (Representational State Transfer APplication Programming Interface) is a standarized way for applications to communicate over HTTP by following a set of principles. It allows clients (like web browsers or mobile apps) to interact with servers to perform operations like fetching or modifying data.
### Key features of a REST API:
1. Stateless Communication: each request from the client to the server must contain all the information needed for the server to process it with no reliance on stored session data.
2. Resource-Based: Data annd functionality are treated as "resources" accessed using endpoints (URLs).
  - Example: `/users` to get a list of users, `/users/1` to access a specific user.
3. HTTP methods: REST APIs use HTTP methods to define actions:
  - GET: Retrieve data
  - POST: create new resources
  - PUT: update existing resources
  - DELETE: Remove resources
4. Structured Responses: Data is typically returned in a lightweight format like JSON or XML
### Why is it used?
  - Interoperability: REST APIs enable communication between different systems and playforms, making them ideal for building web services.
  - Scalability: they are stateless, allowing them to handle more traffic with horizontal scaling.
  - Ease of use: clear structure and standard conventions make it easy for developers to understand and implement.
  - Flexibility: Suitable for a variety of clients, from web applications to mobile and IoT devices.
## Explain the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods
While there is no hard rule stating these methods need to be used in a very specific way, the currently accepted standard, says that:
- GET: Retrieves data from a server (read-only).
- POST: sends data to the server to create or update resources.
## How do you include CSS in an HTML document?
There are two main ways to include CSS into your HTML, you can either do it "inline" or you can do it with the "style" tag.

Inline: Add `style` directly in an HTML element.
```html
<p style="color: red;">Hello</p>
```
Internal: use a `<style>` tag in the `<head>`
```html
<style>
p { color: red; }
</style>
```
External: Link a CSS file using `<link>` in the `<head>`
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" hred="styles.css">
```
## What is the purpose of the div and span tags in HTML?
- `<div>`: this is block-level element that groups other block-level elements (layout or sections) together. It's quite useful for layout definition.
- `<span>`: This inline element is greate for grouping together other inline elements, such as text nodes. Because the `<span>` has no structural impact on the content when used, it's perfect for styling text (or even sections of a larger text) without visually affecting it (other than the actual CSS applied).
## What are CSS selectors, and can oyu name a few types?
CSS selectors are patterns used to select and style specific elements in an HTML document. They define which elements a set of CSS rules should apply to, making them a fundamental part of designing the appearance of web applications and user interfaces.

Why CSS selectors matter

Selectors allow you to target elements precisely, enabling you to control layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of you website. They are essential for creating strucrued and maintainable CSS code.

There are different types of selectors, categorized based on what they target:
- Elements: These selectors reference a specific type of element, and affect all instances of that element throughout the page. Example: `p{}`
- Classes: these selectors only affect those elements that have a matching class. They're greate to target large groups of elements of the same type, without affecting the entire set. Example: `.my-class{}`
- ID: ID-level selectors affect only one element (as IDs can only be used on a single element). They're greate when you have a single element that breaks the pattern from the rest of the group. Example `#my-id{}`
