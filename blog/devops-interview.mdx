# Beginner
## What is DevOps, and why is it important?

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). Its main goal is to shorten (and simplify) the software development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

It is important because it helps to improve collaboration between development and operations team which in turn, translates into increasing deployment frequency, reducing failure ratess of new releases, and speeding up recovery time.

## Explain the difference between continuous integration and continuous deployment.

Continuous integration (CI) involves  automatically building and testing code changes as they are committed to version control systems (usually GIT). This helps catch issues early and improves code quality.

On the other hand, Continuous Deployment (CD) goes a step further by automatically deploying every change that passes the CI process, ensuring that software updates are delivered to user quickly and efficiently without manual intervention.

Combined, they add a greate deal of stability and agility to the development lifecycle.

## What is container, and how is it diffrent from a virtual machine?

A container is a runtime instance of container image (which is a lightweight, executable package that includes everything needed to run your code). It is the execution environment that runs the application or service defined by the container image.

When a container is started, it becomes an isolated process on the host machine with its own filesystem, network interfaces and other resources. Containers share the host operating system's kernel, making them more efficient and quicker to start than virtual machines.

A virtual machine (VM) on the other hand, is an emulation of a physical computer. Each VM runs a full operating system and has virtualized hardware, which makes them more resource-intensive and slower to start compared to containers.

## Name some popular CI/CD tools.

There are too many out there to name them all, but we can group them into two main categories: on-prem and cloud based.

**On-prem CI/CD tools**

These tools allows you to install them on your own infrastructure and don't require any extra external internet access. Some examples are:

- Jenkins
- GitLab CI/CD (can be self-hosted)
- Bamboo
- TeamCity

**Cloud-based CI/CD tools**

On the other hand, these tools either require you to use them from the cloud or are only accessible in SaaS format, which means they provide the infrastructure and you just use their services.

Some Examples of these tools are:
- CircleCI
- TravisCI
- Gitlab CI/CD (cloud version)
- Azure DevOps
- Bitbucket Pipelines

## What is Docker and why is it used?

Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to create, deploy and run napplication within lightweight, portable containers. These containers package an application along with all of its dependencies, libraries and configuration files.

That, in turn, ensures that the application can run consistently across various computing envinronments.

Docker has become one of the most popular DevOps tools because it provides a consistent and isolated environment for development, continuous testing and deployment. This consistency helps to eliminate the common "it works on my machine" problem by ensuring that the application behaves the same way, regardless of wher it is run -- where on a developer's local machine, a testing server, or in production.

Addtionally, Docker simplifies the management of complex applications by allowing developers to break them down into smaller, manageable microservices, each running in its own container.

This approach not only supports but also enhances scalability and flexbility and it makes it seaiser to manage dependencies, version control, and updates.

## Can you explain what infrastructure as code (IaC) is?
![IaC](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/infrastructure-as-code-explained-4dpxm.png)
IaC is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through machine-readable configuration files (in other words, "code"), rather than through physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.

By Keeping this configuration in code format, we now gain the ability to keep it stored in version control platforms, and automate their deployment consistently across environment, reducing the risk of human error and increasing efficiency infrastructure management.

## What are some common IaC tools?

If you're in search of effective configuration management tools to streamline and automate your IT infrastructure, you might consider exploring the following popular options:
- Ansible
- Chef
- Puppet

Configuiration management tools are designed to help DevOps engineers manage and maintain consistent configuration across multiple series and environments. These tools automate the process of configuring deploying and managing systems, ensuring that your infrastructure remains reliable, scalable and compliant with your organization's standards.

## Provisioning and orchestration tools

If, on the other hand, you're looking for tools to handle provisoining and orchestration of your infrastructure, you might want to explore the following popular options:
- Terraform
- CloudFormation (AWS)
- Pulumi

Provisioning and orchestration tools are essential for automating the process of setting up and managing your infrastructure resources. These tools allow you to define your IaC, making it easier to deploy, manage and scale resources across cloud environments.

Finally, if you're looking for multi-purpose tools, you can try something like:
- Ansible (can also be used for provisioning)
- Pulumi (supports both IaC and configuration management)

## What is version control and why is it important in DevOps?

Version control is a system that records changes to files over time so that specific versions can be recalled later or multiple developers can work on the same codebase and eventually merge their work streams together with minimum effort.

It is important in DevOps because it allows multiple team members to collaborate on code, tracks and manages changes efficiently, enables rollback to prrevious versions of issue arise, and supports automation in CI/CD pipelines, ensuring consistent and reliable software delivery (which is one of the key principles of DevOps).

In terms of tooling, one of the best and most popular version control systems ins Git. It Provides what is known as a distributed version control system, giving every team member a pice of the code so they can branch it, work on it however they feel like it, and push it back to the rest of the team once they're done.

That said, there are other legacy teams using alternatives like CVS or SVN.

## Explain the concept of 'shift left' in DevOps
The concept of 'shift left' in DevOps refers to the practice of performing tasks ealier in the software development lifecycle.

This includes integrating testing, security and other quality checks early in the development process rather than at the end. The goal is to identify and fix issues sooner, thus reducing defects, improving quality, and speeding up software delivery times.

## What is a microservice, and how does it differ from a monolithic application?
![monolithic application](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/microservice-vs-monolith-2og84.png)

A microservicde is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, loosely coupled and independently deployable services (hence the term "micro").

Each service focuses on a specific business domain and can communicate with others through well-defined APIs.

In the end, your application is not (usually) composed of a single microservice (that would make it monolith), instead, its architecture consists of multiple microservices working together to serve the incoming requests.

On the other hand, a monolithic application is a single (often massive) unit where all functions and services are interconnected and run as a single process.

THe biggest difference between monoliths and microservices is that changes to a monolithic application require the entire system to be rebuilt and redeployed, while microservices can be developed, deployed and scaled independently, allowing for greater flexbility and resilience.

## What is a build pipeline?

A build pipeline is an automated process that compiles, tests and prepares code for deployment. It typically involves multiple stages, such as source code retrieval code compilation running unit tests, performing static code analysis, creating build artifacts and deploying to one of the available envinronments.

The build pipeline effectively removes humans from the deployment process as much as possible, clearly reducing the chance of human error. This, in turn, ensures consistency and reliability in software build and speeds up the development and deployment process.

## What is the role of a DevOps Engineer?

This is probably one of the most common DevOps interview questions out there because by answering it correctly, you show that you actually know what DevOps engineers (A.K.A "you") are supposed to work on.

That said, this is not a trivial question to answer because different companies will likely implement DevOps with their own "Flavor" and in their own way.

At a high level, the role of a DevOps engineer is to bridge the gap between development and operations teams with the aim of improving the development lifecycle and reducing deployment errors.

With that said other key responsibilities may include:

- Implkementing and managing CI/CD pipelines.
- Automating infrastructure provisioning and configuration using IaC tools.
- Monitoring and maintaining system performance, security and availability.
- Collaborating with developers to streamline code deployments and ensures smooth operations.
- Managing and optimizing cloud infrastructure.
- Ensuring system scalability and reliability.
- Troubleshooting and resolving issues across the development and production envinronments.

## What is Kubernetes, and why is it used?

If we're talking about DevOps tools, then Kubernetes is a must-have.

Specifically, Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform. That means it can automate the deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications.

It is widely used because it simplifies the complex tasks of managing containers for large-scale applications, such as ensuring high availability, load balancing, rolling updates and self-healing.

Kubernetes helps organizations run and manage applications more efficiently and reliably invarious environment including on-premises, cloud or hybrid setups.

## Explain the concept of orchestration in DevOps.

Orchestration in DevOps refers to the automated coordination and management of complex IT systems. it involves combining multiple automated tasks and processes into a single workflow to achieve a specific goal.

Nowadays, automation (or orchestration) is one of the key components of any software development process and it should never be avoided nor preferred over manual configuration.

As an automation practice, orchestration helps to remove the chance of human error from the different steps of the software development lifecycle. This is all to ensure efficient resource utilization and consistency.

Some examples of orchestration can inlcude orchestrating container deployments with kubernetes and automating infrastructure provisioning with tools like Terraform.

## What is a load balancer, and why is it important?
![load balacner](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/loadbalancer-working-eytvi.png)

A load balancer is a device or software that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed.

It is important because it improves the avalability, reliability and performance of applications by evenly distributing the load, preventing server overload, and providing failover capabilities in case of server failures.

Load balancers are usually used when scalling up RESTful microservices, as their stateless nature, you cna set up multiple copies of the same on behind a load balancer and let it distribute the load amongst all copies evenly.

## What is the purpose of a configuration management tool?

When organizations and platforms grow large enough, keeping track of how different areas of the IT ecosystem (infrastructure, deployment pipelines, hardware, etc) are meant to be configured becomes a problem, and finding a way to manage that chaos suddenly becomes a necessity.

That is where configuration management comes into play.

The purpose of a configuration management tool is to automate the process of managing and maintaining the consistency of software and hardware configurations across and organization's infrastructure.

It makes sure that systems are configured correctly, updates are applied uniformly, and configurations are maintained according to predefined standards.

This helps reduce configurations errors, increase efficiency, and ensure that environments are consistent and compliant.

## What is continuous monitoring?

As a DevOps engineer, the concept of continuous monitoring should be ingrained in your bain as a must-perform activity.

You see, continuous monitoring is the practice of constantly overseeing and analyzing an IT system's performance, security and compliance in real-time.

It involves collecting and sessing data from various parts of the infrastructure to detect issues, security threats, and performance bottlenecks as soon as they occur.

The goal is to ensure the system's health, security and compliance, enabling quick responses to potential problems and maintaining the overall stability and reliability of the environment. Toosl like Prometheus, Grafana, Nagios and Splunk are commonly used for continuous monitoring.

## What's the difference between horizontal and vertical scaling?
![horizontal-vertical scaling](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/vertical-scaling-vs-horizontal-scaling-dfy6m.png)

They're both valid scaling techniques, but they both have different limitations on the affected system.

**Horizontal scaling**
- Involves adding more machines or instances to your infrastructure.
- Increases capacity by connecting multiple hardware or software entities sothey work as a single logical unit.
- Often used in distributed systems and cloud environments.

**Vertical scaling**
- Involves adding more resources (CPU, RAM, storage) to an existing machine.
- Increases capacity by enhancing the power of a single server or instance.
- Limited by the maximum capacity of the hardware.

In summary, horizontal scaling adds more machines to handle increased load, while vertical scaling enhances the power of existing machines.

## What is a rollback and when would you perform one?

A rollback is the process of reverting a system to a previous stable state, typically after a failed or problematic deployment to production.

You would perform a rollback when a new deployment causes one or several of the following problems: application crashes, significant bugs, security vulnerabilities or performance problems.

The goal is to restore the system to a known "good" state while minimizing downtime and the impact on users while investigating and resolving the issues with the new deployment.

## Explain what a service mesh is
