## What is DevOps, and why is it important?

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). Its main goal is to shorten (and simplify) the software development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

It is important because it helps to improve collaboration between development and operations team which in turn, translates into increasing deployment frequency, reducing failure ratess of new releases, and speeding up recovery time.

## Explain the difference between continuous integration and continuous deployment.

Continuous integration (CI) involves  automatically building and testing code changes as they are committed to version control systems (usually GIT). This helps catch issues early and improves code quality.

On the other hand, Continuous Deployment (CD) goes a step further by automatically deploying every change that passes the CI process, ensuring that software updates are delivered to user quickly and efficiently without manual intervention.

Combined, they add a greate deal of stability and agility to the development lifecycle.

## What is container, and how is it diffrent from a virtual machine?

A container is a runtime instance of container image (which is a lightweight, executable package that includes everything needed to run your code). It is the execution environment that runs the application or service defined by the container image.

When a container is started, it becomes an isolated process on the host machine with its own filesystem, network interfaces and other resources. Containers share the host operating system's kernel, making them more efficient and quicker to start than virtual machines.

A virtual machine (VM) on the other hand, is an emulation of a physical computer. Each VM runs a full operating system and has virtualized hardware, which makes them more resource-intensive and slower to start compared to containers.

## Name some popular CI/CD tools.

There are too many out there to name them all, but we can group them into two main categories: on-prem and cloud based.

**On-prem CI/CD tools**

These tools allows you to install them on your own infrastructure and don't require any extra external internet access. Some examples are:

- Jenkins
- GitLab CI/CD (can be self-hosted)
- Bamboo
- TeamCity

**Cloud-based CI/CD tools**

On the other hand, these tools either require you to use them from the cloud or are only accessible in SaaS format, which means they provide the infrastructure and you just use their services.

Some Examples of these tools are:
- CircleCI
- TravisCI
- Gitlab CI/CD (cloud version)
- Azure DevOps
- Bitbucket Pipelines

## What is Docker and why is it used?

Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to create, deploy and run napplication within lightweight, portable containers. These containers package an application along with all of its dependencies, libraries and configuration files.

That, in turn, ensures that the application can run consistently across various computing envinronments.

Docker has become one of the most popular DevOps tools because it provides a consistent and isolated environment for development, continuous testing and deployment. This consistency helps to eliminate the common "it works on my machine" problem by ensuring that the application behaves the same way, regardless of wher it is run -- where on a developer's local machine, a testing server, or in production.

Addtionally, Docker simplifies the management of complex applications by allowing developers to break them down into smaller, manageable microservices, each running in its own container.

This approach not only supports but also enhances scalability and flexbility and it makes it seaiser to manage dependencies, version control, and updates.
