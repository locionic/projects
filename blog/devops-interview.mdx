## What is DevOps, and why is it important?

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). Its main goal is to shorten (and simplify) the software development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

It is important because it helps to improve collaboration between development and operations team which in turn, translates into increasing deployment frequency, reducing failure ratess of new releases, and speeding up recovery time.

## Explain the difference between continuous integration and continuous deployment.

Continuous integration (CI) involves  automatically building and testing code changes as they are committed to version control systems (usually GIT). This helps catch issues early and improves code quality.

On the other hand, Continuous Deployment (CD) goes a step further by automatically deploying every change that passes the CI process, ensuring that software updates are delivered to user quickly and efficiently without manual intervention.

Combined, they add a greate deal of stability and agility to the development lifecycle.
