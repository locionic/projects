title: Difference between vercel, local and solutions

summary: The solutions for difference between local, Vercel environments.
---
# IPv6 Networking
Vercel: might be handling requests over IPv4, 
Local: network or machine is attempting to resolve requests over IPv6, causing the timeout.
Solution: Force local environment to prioritize IPv4.
```
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1
```
# Local Firewall, VPN, or Proxy Configuration
Local: firewalls or VPNs might block specific outgoing requests, especially if they're attempting to access external resources.
Solution: Check if there are any firewall rules or VPN settings on local machine that could be blocking outbound requests to the API providers. Can test on a different network (e.g., mobile hotspot) to see if itâ€™s a network-specific issue.
# Localhost DNS Resolution
Explanation: Vercel uses a more reliable DNS setup to resolve domain names quickly, while local environment may face DNS resolution delays or errors, especially when dealing with large-scale, high-traffic services.
Solution: Change the DNS resolver on local machine to something more reliable like Google's public DNS or Cloudflare's DNS:
    Google's DNS: 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4
    Cloudflare's DNS: 1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1
```
sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
```
```
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
```
# Environment Differences (Vercel vs. Local)
Explanation: Vercel handles server-side rendering, API calls, and networking differently than local machine, meaning Vercel may have different server access or networking capabilities.
Solution: Try running Next.js application in a similar environment locally as Vercel's (Linux, Node.js, etc.). Can use Docker to mirror a production-like environment for local development.
```
# Dockerfile
FROM node:16-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
```
# Server-Side Rate Limiting or Blocking
Explanation: Some external providers might block or throttle local IPs, especially if too many requests are made in a short period. Vercel's server IPs might not face the same restrictions.
Solution: Try using a proxy service for external requests or rate-limiting API calls locally to avoid being blocked.
```
const axios = require('axios');
const rateLimit = require('axios-rate-limit');

const axiosInstance = rateLimit(axios.create(), { maxRequests: 2, perMilliseconds: 1000 });

axiosInstance.get('https://example.com/api')
  .then(response => console.log(response.data))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```
# Check Node.js Version
Explanation: Sometimes differences in Node.js versions between Vercel and local machine can cause networking or DNS resolution problems.
Solution: Make sure using the same Node.js version locally as Vercel. Check Vercel's Node.js version in your Vercel dashboard, and then match it locally using nvm:
```
nvm install <version>  # Replace <version> with the specific Node.js version used by Vercel
nvm use <version>
```
