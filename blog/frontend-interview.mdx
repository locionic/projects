## What is the difference between an id and a class in HTML/CSS?
An id is a unique identifier for a single HTML element. A class is a reusable identifier that can be applied to multiple elements.

You'd want to use an id when you need to addresss a single element either through CSS or JavaScript. And you'll want to use a class when you need to address a group of DOM elements.
In CSS:
- #id selects a specific element with that id.
- **.class** selects all elements with that class.
Một **id** là một định danh duy nhất cho một phần tủ HTML. Một **class** là một định danh có thể tái sủ dụng và có thể được áp dụng cho nhiều phần tử.
Bạn nên sủ dụng **id** khi cần nhắm đến một phần tử duy nhất bằng CSS hoặc JavaScript. Còn **class** d9uoc5 dùng khi bạn cần nhắm đến một phóm phần tủ trong DOM.
Trong CSS:
- **#id** chọn một phần tủ cụ thể có id đó.
- **.class** chọn tất cả các phần tử có class đó.
## Can you explain the box model in CSS?
The CSS box model describes the rectangular boxes generated for elements in DOM. The box model is composed of the following layers:
1. **Content**: The innermost part, where text and images appear.
2. **Padding**: The space between the content and the border.
3. **Border**: The outer edge of the padding, surrounding the element.
4. **Margin**: The space outside the border, separating the lement from others.
By controlling each layer indivilually, you can define the look of each element in the user interface.
Mô hình hộp (CSS Box Model) mô tả các hộp hình chữ nhật được tạo ra cho các phần tử trong DOM. Mô hình này bao gồm các lớp sau:
1. **Content (Nội dung)**: Phần bên trong cùng, nơi hiển thị văn bản và hình ảnh.
2. **Padding (Lề trong)**: Khoảng cách giũa nội dung và viền.
3. **Border (Viền)**: Rìa ngoài của phần padding, bao quanh phần tử.
4. **Margin (Lề ngoài)**: Khoảng cách bên ngoài viền, tách phần tử ra khỏi các phần tử khác.
Bằng cách điều chỉnh từng lớp riêng lẻ, bạn có thể định dạng giao diện của từng phần tử trong giao diện người dùng.
## What is the difference between inline, inline-block, and block elements?
In CSS, the difference between **inline**, **inline-block**, and **bloick** elements is on the way they're rendered in the web page:
- **inline**: Inline elements don't have a width or height. Instead, they don't start on a new line and take up only the width that's required (based on their content). Examples: <span>, <a>.
- **inline-block**: Just like inline elements, here the DOM elements do not start on a new line, however, they do allow you to set a hieight and width on them. Example: <img>.
- **block**: Elements start on a new line, taking up the full width available by default. Their width and height can be set by you. Examples: <div>, <p>.
## What are some SEO best practices when structuring an HTML document?
Purely from the HTML side:
- **Use Semantic HTML**: Use tags like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <section> and <footer> to provide meaningful structure.
- **Proper Heading Hierarchy**: Use headings (<h1> to <h6>) correctly, making sure <h1> is used once per page for the main title, followed by <h2>, <h3>, etc.
- **Meta Tags**: include relevant <meta> tags, such as description, keywords and viewport, to provide metadata about the website.
- **Alt Attributes on images**: use alt attributes for images to describe the content, improving accessibility and search engine understanding.
On top of that:
- **Internal Linking**: make sure to use internal links to connect content within your web site, helping search engines crawl and understand the site structure.
- **Mobile-Friendly Design**: Code your site and CSS with a mobile-first mindset. Ensuring the site is responsive and mobile-friendly to improve user experience and ranking on search engines.
- **Fast loading times**: Tryo to optimize images, use efficient code, and leverage caching to improve page load speeds. The faster the page loads, the bigger the advantage it'klll have against other similar results on the SERP.
## What is the Document Object Model (DOM)?
The DOM is an API for web documents. It represents the structure of an HTML web page as a tree of nodes, where each node corresponds to a part of the document (i.e. an element, an attribute, or text).
## How do you add an event listener to an element?
To add an event listener to an element, you have to first "get" that element through one of the many methods of the doucment object (i.e. getElementById, etc) and then use the addEAventListener method of the obtained object.
The method wil lreceive the event name (i.e . 'click', 'keyup', 'mouseup', etc), the event handler function and , optionally, a boolean indicating whether the event should be captured during the capturing phase.
## What is the difference between null and undefined?
In JavaScript, "undefined" is the default value new variables take, and it means the variable has been defined but it hasn't been assigned any value just yet.
And "null" is actually a value that signals "no value" or "no object", it is specifically assigned to the variable by the developer.
## What is the difference between cookies, sessionStorage, and LocalStorage?
**Cookies** are small pieces of data stored in web browsers. They are mainly used for keeping information between HTTP requests, such as user authentication, session management, and tracking user behavior.
On the other hand, **sessionStorage** is designed for temporary storage and is accessible only with in the same session (i.e.., while the browser window or tab is open). Data Stored in sessionStorage is lost when the browser window is closed.
Finally, localStorage is similar to sessionStorage but persists even when the browser window or tab is closed and reoipened. It provides long-term storage for web applications. They are very similar to cookies, however, the size limitations on localStorage are quite big compared to cookies, making it a much better alternative when storing large datasets.
## How does the browser render a website?
THe process of rendering a web page in the browser involves several steps:
1. Parsing the HTML.
2. Parsing the CSS and applying styles.
3. Calculating the position of each element in the layout of the page.
4. Painting the actual pixels in the screen, while at the same time sorting them into layers.
5, Composing all layers together, to render the website on screen. This step is taking into account z-index values, opacity values and more.
6. Running JavaScript code.
7. Loading the asynchronous resources.
## What are media queries?
Media queries are a feature in CSS that allow Frontend developers to apply different styles to a doccument based on various characteristics of the device or viewport. For example, you can set different styles based on the device's width, height, orientation, or type.
Through media queries we can achieve responsive design allowing styles to adapt to different screen sizes and devie capabilities.
