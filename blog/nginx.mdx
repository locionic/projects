# Trailing slash
```
Without trailing slash:
location /chatpppeee {
  ...
}
URL: example.com/chatpppeee/users
→ Proxied to: localhost:9000/chatpppeee/users

With trailing slash:
location /chatpppeee/ {
  ...
}
URL: example.com/chatpppeee/users
→ Proxied to: localhost:9000/users
```
The trailing slash matters because:
 - Path Stripping: With trailing slash, Nginx strips the location prefix from the URI before forwarding
 - URI Consistency: Helps maintain clean URLs in your FastAPI application (you don't need to handle the /chatpppeee prefix in your routes)
 - Avoiding Double Paths: Prevents issues where you might accidentally have the path twice in the URL
Without the trailing slash, you would need to either:
 - Include /chatpppeee in all your application routes, or
 - Configure your application to use a root path prefix
