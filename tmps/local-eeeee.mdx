## The Problem

You try to get the vertical position of an element like this:

```js
window.scrollY
```
...but it always returns 0.

Even worse, this common pattern also fails:
```js
element.getBoundingClientRect().top + window.scrollY
```
If you're inspecting the ChatGPT web UI, this can be very confusing.

## Why `window.scrollY` Is Always 0
In ChatGPT (and many modern web apps):
 - The page itself does not scroll
 - Scrolling happens inside a nested container
 - The `<body>` is fixed-height
